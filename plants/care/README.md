# General Plant Care
## Light

We need to consider the entire environment when determining the sunlight needs of the plant. The following considerations need to be taken into account.

Temperature: In extremely hot regions the general classifications of sunlight requirments may not be directly applicable. For example, some plants might need to be protected from the intense, hot, afternoon sun, even if they prefer "full sun".

Time of day of light: Morning light is cooler and less intese than afternoon light. Plants that like shade often prefer morning light.

### Terms

Direct Sunlight: Sunlight is hitting the plant without reflecting off any other surfaces.

Indirect sunlight: the sunlight is reflecting off of another surface before hitting the plant. This could also be sunlight that is coming through a window as the window will filter some of the light.

Dappled Light: "Dappled light" is light that is only hitting part of the plant (such as light through a covering tree).

### General Classifications

The general classifications listed below are often used when refering to the sunlight requirments of a plant. These classifications are not completely fixed. When considering the classification of the light recieved in a specific location one needs to take the intesity of the light (direct, indirect, dappled, etc.) and the duration into account. All combinations of light intensity and duration are not accounted for in the following classifications. One should always pay attention to the status of the plant and adjust accordingly, even if it is somewhat contrary to the specific suggested requirments for a plant (although the specific requirments should not be ignored completely).

Full-Sun: At least 6 hours of direct sunlight a day. The more the better.

Partial Sunlight / Light Shade: 4 to 6 hours of direct sunlight a day.

Partial Shade: 2 hours of direct sunlight a day. Or half a day of indirect light.

Full Shade/ Low Light: No direct sunlight. Indirect sunlight is still needed.

### Signs of lighting problems
A plant might not be getting enough sunlight if one or more of the following symptoms are present.

* Plants turn pale green, yellow, or white. Less chlorophyll is not produced when lacking sufficent light.

* Plant stems become long and thin ("leggy"). The plant is attempting to find a light source.

* Long spaces between leaf nodes on stems.

* Plant droping leaves.

* Variegated plants return to solid green.

* Plants losing color.

* Flowering plants not producing buds.

If the plant is getting too much sunlight it can become scorched, bleached, and limp.
