# Vanilla planifolia

## Sunlight
Partial Sun. Avoid direct hot mid-day sun.

## Water
Rainfall is moderate to heavy from late spring to early autumn. Water heavily while actively growing. Water should be reduced in autumn after new growths mature. 
Significantly reduce watering in winter, but don't let go without water for long periods. Water should be increased somewhat if leaves shrivel or show signs of stress.

## Food
Fertilize at standard rates every other watering during the summer. Occasionally flush with fresh water.

## Medium
Standard Orchid mix

## Temperature
Perfers 70F-90F during the day. Keep above 60F.

## Humidity


## Pot/Repotting
Probably best grown in shallow, well-drained pots or baskets. Repotting should be done just as new roots start to grow. This enables the plant to become reestablished in the shortest possible time.
 
## Toxicity

## Problems

## Flowering
Flowering the Vanilla vine takes a bit of time and patience. Although the flowers are slightly fragrant, it is the vanilla bean pod that follows flowering that is the prize. Plants that are grown in a container need a support and the vine needs to reach a height of 3-5 feet. Using a clay pot of 12 inches or more will give your orchid size, stability and also a healthy root system. Be sure to have excellent drainage with a porous potting mix and drainage hole in the bottom of the pot.

The vining stem is then tied to the support to begin its upward growth. Keep it in warm temperatures and bright light. The vine should be encouraged to climb and tied to the support as needed. Offshoots will occur, especially when there is a bend in the stem, and these should also be tied to the support. In time, the support will become covered with vines (this adds up to many feet of vine) and once they reach the top and start to hang off the support, then flowering will begin.

What initiates bloom is somewhat variable. It is thought that a dry period for a couple of months in the winter, as well as the vine reaching the top of the support and cascading off stimulates the flowering process. The blooms appear on flowering spikes that emerge at the leaf axis along the stems and many blooms will emerge from this spike over a period of weeks, usually one at a time and each flower lasts only one day. To produce vanilla beans, the flowers need to be hand pollinated, which is easily done with a toothpick.
