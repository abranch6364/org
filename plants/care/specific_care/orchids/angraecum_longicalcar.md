## Sunlight
 Angraecum longicalcar needs a light level of 30000-45000 lux (partial shade to partial sun). Light should be filtered or diffused, and plants should not be exposed to direct midday sun. Plants will not bloom without good light. Strong air movement should be provided at all times.

## Water
Rainfall is moderate to heavy from late spring to early autumn. Water heavily while actively growing. Water should be reduced in autumn after new growths mature. 
Significantly reduce watering in winter, but don't let go without water for long periods. Water should be increased somewhat if leaves shrivel or show signs of stress.

## Food
1/4-1/2 recommended strength, applied weekly when plants are actively growing. You can use a high-nitrogen fertilizer from spring to midsummer, then switch to one high in phosphates in late summer and autumn. No fertilizer during the winter.

## Medium
Use a coarse medium such as bark.

## Temperature
Summer: 82F average during day. 62F average during night.

Winter: 73F average during day. 50F average during night

## Humidity
70-75% in summer and autumn, dropping to 60-65% for about 3 months in late winter and early spring.

## Pot/Repotting
Probably best grown in shallow, well-drained pots or baskets. Repotting should be done just as new roots start to grow. This enables the plant to become reestablished in the shortest possible time.
