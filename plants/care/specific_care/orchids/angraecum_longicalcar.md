## Sunlight
 Angraecum longicalcar needs a light level of 30000-45000 lux (partial shade to partial sun). Light should be filtered or diffused, and plants should not be exposed to direct midday sun. Plants will not bloom without good light. Strong air movement should be provided at all times.

## Water
In its natural habitat, rainfall is moderate to heavy from late spring to early autumn. Averages then drop rather abruptly in mid-autumn at the beginning of the dry season, that lasts about 5 months until late winter or early spring.

Water heavily while actively growing. Water should be reduced in autumn after new growths mature. Good drainage is required though as it does not like to remain wet. 
Significantly reduce watering in winter, but don't let go without water for long periods. Water should be increased somewhat if leaves shrivel or show signs of stress.

## Food
1/4-1/2 recommended strength, applied weekly when plants are actively growing. You can use a high-nitrogen fertilizer from spring to midsummer, then switch to one high in phosphates in late summer and autumn. No fertilizer during the winter.

## Medium
Use a coarse medium such as bark. Roots dislike being distrubed so another option is lava rock to limit need to repot.

## Temperature
Summer: 82F average during day. 62F average during night.

Winter: 73F average during day. 50F average during night

## Humidity
70-75% in summer and autumn, dropping to 60-65% for about 3 months in late winter and early spring.

## Pot/Repotting
Limit repotting as the roots do not like to be distrubed.
 
## Toxicity
???

## Problems
If roots are distrubed it can set back plant growth by years.
