# Habenaria Medusa
[Source](https://travaldo.blogspot.com/2018/05/habenaria-medusa-care-and-culture.html)

## Sunlight
Full Shade, Part Shade

## Water
During the rest period this orchid does not get water; the substrate where there are tubers is slightly moistened. 
In spring, when the new jet reaches the surface, it starts slowly with watering; however, it get water with such caution, 
only along the edges of the vase, and the water must not touch the jet in any way, otherwise it will rot. 
The substrate during this period must remain moist but not so much, and the next watering occurs when the 
substrate has dried almost completely. Only when the rosette of leaves has formed does it begin with the most abundant watering; 
the substrate must always remain very wet. When the stem dies in autumn, the watering is suspended, the substrate is allowed to dry completely.

## Food
Low amounts during growing season. 1/4 of normal recommended amount every couple of weeks.

## Medium
Standard Coarse Orchid Mix. Large enough pot for multiplication of tubers

## Temperature
60-75 degrees in growing phase
~60 degrees in resting phase

## Humidity
65-80%

## Pot/Repotting
Replace growing medium and seperate tubers during / after dying back

## Toxicity
???

## Problems

## Rest Period
 After flowering, when the inflorescence is dry, the leaves begin to turn yellow, 
 and this is the sign that from now the plant will accumulate the nutrients in the tuber, 
 producing others (and then dying the present one). When the stem of the plant is completely dead, 
 the tubers must be checked. If the tuber who has just finished the season died without 
 multiplying, it means that something went wrong in cultivation. If it has multiplied, 
 but the new tubers are smaller, something needs to be improved (and attention to the following season, 
 these "weakened" tubers will not be able to multiply if conditions are not perfect). If the new tubers 
 are the same size or even larger than the mother tuber, the cultivation has been successful! 
 The extracted tubers are placed in a handful of substrate that must be kept just wet (not to let them dehydrate) 
 and so they pass the resting phase that lasts until spring. The conditions of the rest are: temperatures of 15-16 Â° C, 
 total absence of fertilizations and light evaporations of the substratum 1-2 times a week to keep it slightly moist. 
 In the spring the tubers are planted in the pot and the cycle begins again.
