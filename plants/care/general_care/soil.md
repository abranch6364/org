## Custom Potting Mix
### Potting Mix Properties
- Light and airy so plants can easily root and acces oxygen in soil
- Long-lasting. Won't break down or compact
- Moisture-retentive. Holds water so reduce watering needs
- Nutrients


### Ingredients
#### Sphagnum Peat Moss
- Primary ingredient in most potting soils. 
- Long time to break down
- Inexpensive. 
- It holds water well once wet, however it is hydrophobic when dry.
- Well drainging and well-aerated.
- Low nutrients
- Acidic pH (3.5-4.5). Limestone is added (1/4 cup per 6 gallons) to balance the pH.
- Easily available

#### Coir Fiber
- Alternative to sphagnum peat moss.
- More nutrients
- Lasts longer
- More expensive.
- Neutral pH, no limestone needed.

#### Perlite
- Mined, volcanic rock.
- Holds 3-4 times its weight in water.
- Increases pore space
- Improves drainage
- Neutral pH
- Easily available

#### Vermiculite
- Mined mineral
- Adds calcium and magnesium
- Increases water-holding capacity

#### Sand
- Improves drainage (some controversy here)

#### Poultry Grit
- Improves drainage

#### Turface (Calcified Clay)
- Improves drainage
- Nasa Floor Dry #8222

#### Pumice
- Imporves drainage

#### Limestone
- Neutralizes pH of peat-based mixes
- 1/4 cup per 6 gllons of peat moss

#### Fertilizers
- Adds nutriants
- Ideally natural fertilizer is used

#### Uncomposted Bark Fines

#### Crushed Granite (Gran-I-Grit)
- Improves drainage

#### Chicken Grit
- Improves drainage

#### Composted Wood Chips
- Increases pore sizes
- Slow to breakdown, but rob nitrogen from the soil when they do
- Adding some blood meal or alfalfa meal can offset the nitrogen issue

#### Compost
- Provides nutrients
- Holds water
- Important

### Recipes
#### Basic Mix
For most outddor potted plants.

- 1 part Peat Moss
- Limestone to neutralize pH as needed
- 1 part Compost
- 1 part Perlite
- Fertilizer if desired

#### AI Gritty Mix
For succulents and cacti

- 1 part Uncomposted Bark Fines (1/8" to 3/8")
- 1 part Crushed Granite (Gran-I-Grit) or Chicken Grit (Grower's size) or #2 Cherrystone

Sift out finer particles.

#### DIY Fertilizer
- 2 cups rock phosphate
